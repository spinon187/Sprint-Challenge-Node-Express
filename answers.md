 Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

I learned that Express can parse JSON objects on its own and it runs asynchronously.

 Describe Middleware?

 Middleware is a type of function that passes both inputs and outputs, and in Express will execute in the sequence it's invoked.

 Describe a Resource?

 Everything is a resource but I guess the best way I can think to describe it is an object with data in it.

 What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

 It can return a digit, a status type, a message, the modified object data itself, or any combination of those things.

 How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

 We can chain Express routers together and pass the data between sub-applications via middleware.
